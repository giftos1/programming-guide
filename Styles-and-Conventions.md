(PEP = Python Enhancement Proposal)

* The main standard style guide for Python is described in PEP 8 https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008
* PEP 257 for docstrings https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257
* Here's an example demonstrating PEP 257 docstring styles http://dolphm.com/pep257-good-python-docstrings-by-example
