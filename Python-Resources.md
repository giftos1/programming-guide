This page is not intended to be an exhaustive collection, but simply a list of good resources we know of that you might find useful for learning Python (or other languages) programming.  
Please note that your uni subject course materials are always the best starting point. These are _extra_ things, not replacements for anything in the subject.

* http://www.skulpt.org - Skulpt is an entirely in-browser implementation of Python.

* http://www.pythonchallenge.com - A gamified Python challenge to help you learn.
* http://askpython.com - Materials and exercises for the Python 3 programming language. In this course you will learn how to write basic code and see examples.
* https://www.codewars.com - Level up by completing programming challenges (lots of language options); see and rate solutions from others.

If you know of any other great resources, let us know and we might add them to this list.
